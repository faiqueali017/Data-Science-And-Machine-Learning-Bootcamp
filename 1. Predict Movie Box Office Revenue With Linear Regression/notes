y = mx + c

m(Slope) = how much the 'y' will change for a given change in 'x'. 
           The larger the slope value the steeper the line becomes.
           
           The stronger the relationship the steeper the slope.
           
Fitted value = The difference b/w actual data points and the point on the line. 
               The point on the line is the fitted value.
               
Residual =   Imaginary line of the fitted value. It helps us choose between how 
             good the line we are drawing. Look at the size of the residual and choose 
             the line with the smallest residuals.
